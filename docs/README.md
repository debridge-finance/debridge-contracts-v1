# Introduction

**deBridge** — **a cross-chain interoperability and liquidity transfer protocol** that allows truly decentralized transfer of arbitrary data and assets between various blockchains. The cross-chain intercommunication of deBridge smart contracts is powered by the network of independent oracles/validators which are elected by deBridge governance.

The protocol enables transfers of assets between various blockchains via locking/unlocking of the asset on the native chain and issuing/burning the wrapped asset (deAsset) on secondary chains or L2s. Cross-chain communication between different blockchains is maintained by elected validators who run the deBridge node to perform validation of cross-chain transactions that pass between smart contracts of the deBridge protocol in different blockchains.&#x20;

Delegated staking and slashing mechanics act as a backbone for the protocol security and prevent economical incentives for validators to get into collusion.

The deBridge protocol is an infrastructure platform and a hooking service which aims to become a standard for:\
– cross-chain interoperability and composability of smart contracts \
– cross-chain swaps\
– bridging of any arbitrary asset\
– interoperability and bridging of NFTs\
\
The protocol will be controlled by a DAO with decentralized governance which allows all token holders to have a word in the future decisions regarding protocol parameters, management of the treasury, and participate in the future growth.&#x20;

deBridge project commenced during the [Chainlink Global Hackathon](https://chain.link/hackathon) where the team strived to solve the urgent problem of transferring data and liquidity between blockchains and of the lack of a single decentralized standard for bridging assets. The project was awarded the grand prize and took first place among more than 140 teams worldwide.
