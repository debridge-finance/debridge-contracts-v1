# Introduction

**deBridge Liquidity Network** uses a 0-TVL cross-chain trading infrastructure to facilitate high-performance cross-chain exchange. Instead of using liquidity pools, the DLN executes all trades asynchronously through a self-organized liquidity network, providing developers and projects with the ability to leverage the fastest cross-chain experience on the market and transfer liquidity and information with faster time to finality than any legacy cross-chain solution.

By shifting the cross-chain paradigm from bridging to networking, deBridge enables myriad unique features for applications and users:

* Near-instant settlement
* Limit orders for any cross-chain trade
* Zero slippage on any order size
* Unlimited market depth
* Guaranteed rates and low fees
* Native token trading (no custodial risks of wrapped assets)
* Zero locked liquidity at risk (0-TVL)
* Rapidly scalable (can process any trading volume)
* Gasless limit orders (users can commit orders without any upfront costs â€” tokens are deducted only if execution is guaranteed on the destination chain) _(coming soon)_
* Order + call data allows adding instructions to be executed together alongside order fulfillment
