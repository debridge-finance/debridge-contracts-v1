# Authentication

Currently, the DLN API is open to everyone and doesn't require authentication. To make sure we keep delivering a high-quality service, we're going to introduce a requirement for commercial integrations to authenticate requests with dedicated API keys later in Q4 2024. After a short grace period, we'll limit requests made without such keys.

Please fill in the [Authentication Request form](https://forms.gle/doWLQpr8oemphoaf9) so we can provide you with a dedicated API key and assistance as soon as the authentication requirement would get shipped.
