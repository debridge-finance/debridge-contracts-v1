# Interacting with the API

The DLN API provides developers an effortless way to interact with the DLN protocol and trade across chains in seconds with deep liquidity, limit orders, and protection against slippage and MEV. The API takes the burden off of building complex and sometimes painful interactions with blockchain RPCs and smart contracts by providing a complete set of RESTful endpoints, sufficient to quote, create, and manage trades during their whole lifecycle.
