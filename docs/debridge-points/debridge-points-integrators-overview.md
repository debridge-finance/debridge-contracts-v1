# deBridge Points: Integrators Overview

Last updated: April 9, 2024

Note: This document is a draft and any points specifications may be subject to change in the future.

### Overview

We’re super excited to introduce and announce the deBridge points program, an ecosystem initiative we have launched for all our stakeholders including current and future project partners and integrators to have a way to gain points based on the value and fees they have provided to the deBridge ecosystem which will be rewarded later this year.&#x20;

Points are meant to act as a significant incentive for projects to facilitate integration as points will be accumulated based on users' activity (25% goes to the specific integrator) and this will give each project a say in the future governance and value-creation within the deBridge ecosystem.&#x20;

### How does it work?&#x20;

Projects can integrate our cross-chain infrastructure in different ways — deBridge messaging, deBridge Widget, and deBridge API — to start accumulating points. Your users will earn 100 points for every $1 in fees paid to the protocol. Similarly, paying $10 in fees will earn 1000 points for this example transaction, and you will receive 25%.&#x20;

We believe those who have used deBridge and our applications deserve a share in our collective and future success. The launch of this program is a medium to incorporate decentralized governance and hand over power to the community in the future which includes users, project integrators, community members, and other stakeholders.&#x20;

### How to start accumulating points?&#x20;

Here are our go-to docs with details on how to get started in the best possible way:&#x20;

1. deBridge messaging: [https://docs.debridge.finance/build-with-debridge/getting-started](https://docs.debridge.finance/build-with-debridge/getting-started)
2. deBridge API: [https://docs.dln.trade/dln-api/quick-start-guide](https://docs.dln.trade/dln-api/quick-start-guide)
3. deBridge Widget: [https://docs.debridge.finance/cross-chain-trading/deswap-widget](https://docs.debridge.finance/cross-chain-trading/deswap-widget)

### How to make sure your integration activity is accounted for

All projects need to generate the specific referral link that they pass on the backend of the deBridge integration they do to make sure they get the 25% referring bonus. Here’s how you do it:&#x20;

1. Pick the chain from here as Polygon: [https://app.debridge.finance/](https://app.debridge.finance/). In the top right corner, you will see the polygon chain icon.
2. Go to [https://app.debridge.finance/statistic/](https://app.debridge.finance/statistic/) and click generate
3. Add your tracking code to the integration on the backend
4. Go to the statistics page and see your stats live

Extra: Please share the code with us if you haven’t already.&#x20;

### Where to see your deBridge points

You will be able to see your deBridge points by visiting this website and connecting the wallet address you used to generate the referral link: [https://explorer.debridge.finance/statistic/](https://explorer.debridge.finance/statistic/)&#x20;

More details on this will be shared after the points program is live, but we can say that it will not be for an extensive period.
