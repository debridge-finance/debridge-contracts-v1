# Security

### Has deBridge been audited?

Yes, deBridge's smart contracts have been audited by [Halborn](https://halborn.com/), [Zokyo](https://www.zokyo.io/), [Ackee Blockchain](https://ackeeblockchain.com/) and [Neodyme](https://neodyme.io/).

Security will always be deBridge's main priority and it is vital for the protocol to be reliable and secure at all times. Itâ€™s one of the main components that will determine the future progression of cross-chain interoperability, and as such the deBridge team will maintain this as a main focus area both before and after the protocol launch.&#x20;

Some of our key focus areas and security strategies can be found in [this blog post](https://blog.debridge.finance/10-strategies-for-cross-chain-security-8ed5f5879946).

### Third-party security audits

deBridge protocol and periphery modules passed more than 25+ security audits. A comprehensive list of audit reports can be found in the [deBridge GitHub repository](https://github.com/debridge-finance/debridge-security).

### Immunefi bug bounty program

deBridge has presented a $200,000 Bug Bounty Program on Immunefi.&#x20;

This bug bounty program is focused on preventing:

* Loss of user funds locked (principal) by freezing or theft
* Loss of governance funds
* Theft of unclaimed assets
* Permanent freezing of unclaimed assets
* Smart contract fails to deliver promised returns
* Unauthorized minting of wrapped assets that will lead them to lose peg
