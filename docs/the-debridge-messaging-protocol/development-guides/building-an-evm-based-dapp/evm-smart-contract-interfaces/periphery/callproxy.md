# Variables

## DEBRIDGE_GATE_ROLE
```solidity
  bytes32 public constant DEBRIDGE_GATE_ROLE;
```
Role allowed to withdraw fee
## submissionChainIdFrom
```solidity
  uint256 public submissionChainIdFrom;
```

# Functions
## initialize
```solidity
  function initialize(
  ) public
```




## call
```solidity
  function call(
            address _reserveAddress,
            address _receiver,
            bytes _data,
            uint256 _flags,
            bytes _nativeSender,
            uint256 _chainIdFrom
  ) external returns (bool _result)
```

Used for calls where native asset transfer is involved.

### Parameters:

| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`_reserveAddress` | address | Receiver of the tokens if the call to _receiver fails
|`_receiver` | address | Contract to be called
|`_data` | bytes | Call data
|`_flags` | uint256 | Flags to change certain behavior of this function, see Flags library for more details
|`_nativeSender` | bytes | Native sender
|`_chainIdFrom` | uint256 | Id of a chain that originated the request

## callERC20
```solidity
  function callERC20(
            address _token,
            address _reserveAddress,
            address _receiver,
            bytes _data,
            uint256 _flags,
            bytes _nativeSender,
