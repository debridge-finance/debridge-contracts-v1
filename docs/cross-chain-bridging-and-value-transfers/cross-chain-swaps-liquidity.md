# Cross-Chain Swaps Liquidity

{% hint style="info" %}
[deSwap App](https://app.debridge.finance/deswap) and API were migrated to [DLN](https://dln.trade/) ‚Äî a high-performance cross-chain trading infrastructure built on deBridge with a unique 0-TVL design (no liquidity pools).

## **deSwap cross-chain pools at Curve**

deBridge is a decentralized infrastructure that is fully composable with the existing DeFi ecosystem. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt need to invent our own AMM or DEX, but just create liquidity pools for deAssets in existing DEXs. In every blockchain supported by deBridge, there will be a liquidity pool for deUSDC at Curve or protocols that support the concept of the stable swap.

Cross-chain swaps are one of the applications built on top of deBridge infrastructure that enables users to perform swaps from any asset on one chain to any asset on another.

Here are the instructions on how to deposit liquidity into the pool for each blockchain/L2.
